    <p>
      Saylani Welfare International Trust is a non-government organization (NGO)
      focusing primarily on feeding the poor and homeless. It was established in
      May 1999 and is headquartered at Bahdurabad, Karachi, Pakistan.[1] It was
      founded and headed by spiritual and religious scholar Maulana Bashir
      Farooq Qadri.[2][3] With an estimated monthly expenditure of Pakistani
      Rupees above 30 million, Saylani Trust provides food twice a day to more
      than 30,000 poor people through its 100 centers (generally known as
      Dastar-Khawan), most of them are serving in Karachi.[4][5] The
      organization distributed CNG rickshaws among the jobless citizens of
      Karachi in April 2011 with the help of members of the Karachi business
      community.
